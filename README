Just a simple demonstration of a node.js and google drive api integration

lets you login with your google account and then simply lists out the mp4 files in your drive. 

Once logged in it becomes pretty simple to start making queries for google data since I am using the google node.js api client found here https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client/

clone this repo. 

cd learning_node

node index.js 

then visit localhost:8888 in your browser. 

I made a sample google account that already has videos loaded. 
user spencerdevel 
pass: helloworld11

Yeah I know this is public, but it is just a dummy email account used for demo so don't really care.
