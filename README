Just a simple demonstration of a node.js and google drive api integration

lets you login with your google account and then simply lists out the mp4 files in your drive. 

clone this repo. 

cd learning_node

node index.js 

then visit localhost:8888 in your browser. 

I made a sample google account that already has videos loaded. 
user spencerdevel 
pass: helloworld11

Yeah I know this is public, but it is just a dummy email account so don't really care. 


Technology being used
bootstrap
node.js
handlebars.js
google api client https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client/

The google api client is pretty straight forward and does a lot of the api query work for you.
